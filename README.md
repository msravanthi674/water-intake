## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the AI Water Tracker on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd water-intake-agent
    ```
    (Note: As the project was provided as files, this step assumes it's part of a larger repository. If not, simply ensure all files are in a single directory.)

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    The `requirements.txt` file lists all necessary libraries.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `DATABASE_URL`.
    ```dotenv
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openrouter_api_key_here"
    DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///water-tracker.db
    ```
    *Replace `"your_openrouter_api_key_here"` with your actual API key from OpenRouter.*

### Running the Application

1.  **Run the Streamlit Dashboard:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run dashboard.py
    ```
    This command will open the AI Water Tracker dashboard in your web browser.

## üöÄ Usage

1.  **Start Tracking**: Click the "Start Tracking" button on the welcome page.
2.  **Enter User ID**: Provide a unique user ID in the sidebar. The default is `user_123`.
3.  **Log Water Intake**: Enter the amount of water (in ml) you've consumed and click "Submit".
4.  **View Feedback and History**: The dashboard will display AI feedback and update your intake history, including a line chart visualizing your progress.
